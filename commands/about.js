My name is **${bot.user.username}** ðŸŽ‰ *\`if you don't know yet\`*, currently developed by <@326966683187281922>. I'm a bot heavily inspired by [Typeracer](https://play.typeracer.com), created for you and your friend to play typeracer on Discord!

There is some things that you're **not** allowed to do while playing, which is:
    **1**. Cheating (Copy Paste, Macro, etc.)
    **2**. Trolling
    **3**. Spamming (Text, New Game, etc.)
My developer added a small anti-cheat to prevent cheating but I believe you players to **not** cheat by any means ðŸ˜ƒ.
